          <h5>Past</h5>
          <p style="color: white;">Technology in the past was quite limited and different from current times. In the mid-90s,
            there were still landline phones, floppy disks, fax machines, VHS tapes, cassette tapes, 
            and programming itself was very different from what it is today, with limited tools and 
            resources and a much slower and manual development process.
            The first computer in the world was created in 1946, the ENIAC, 
            which weighed 30 tons, was 5.50 meters tall and 25 meters long, 
            and occupied 180 square meters of floor space. When the ENIAC was 
            first used, the power consumption was so high that the lights in 
            Philadelphia flickered!</p>
